# FIFA World Cup Analytics Dashboard

Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize 90+ years of FIFA World Cup data. Used Python, Dash, and Plotly to create dynamic maps and filters, helping analysts explore historical trends. Automated data collection with web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Pandas) to eliminate manual effort. Deployed on AWS EC2 with Nginx and WSGI for high performance and reliability. Improved data processing speed from hours to real-time with automated validation.
